# Decision Tree Algorithm
* A decision tree is flowchart-like tree structure.
* Decision Tree shares internal decision-making logic(white box type).
* Training time is faster than the neural network algorithm.
* The decision tree is a<strong>distribution-free</strong> or <strong>non-parametric method</strong>, which does not depend upon probability distribution assumptions.
* Decision trees can handle high dimensional data with good accuracy.
